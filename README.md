Overview
--------

JNI bindings for **Zstd** native library that provides fast and high
compression lossless algorithm for Android, Java and all JVM languages:

* static compress/decompress methods

* implementation of InputStream and OutputStream for transparent compression
of data streams fully compatible with the "zstd" program.

* minimal performance overhead

Zstd
----

**Zstd**, short for Zstandard, is a new lossless compression algorithm, which
provides both good compression ratio _and_ speed for your standard compression
needs. "Standard" translates into everyday situations which neither look for
highest possible ratio (which LZMA and ZPAQ cover) nor extreme speeds (which
LZ4 covers).

**Zstd** is developed by Yann Collet and the source is available at:
https://github.com/facebook/zstd

The motivation for development, the algorithm used and its properties are
explained in the blog post that introduces the library:
http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2015/01/zstd-stronger-compression-algorithm.html

Status and availability
-----------------------

**Zstd** is production ready with a stable format.

**Zstd-jni** is tracking the release branch of **Zstd** (master) with
compatibility support for the legacy formats (since version 0.4).

**Zstd-jni** version uses the base **Zstd** version with **Zstd-jni** release
appended with a dash, e.g. "1.2.0-2" is the second **Zstd-jni** release based
on **Zstd** version 1.2.0.

Limitations
-----------
The Java classes cannot be renamed/minimized/relocated. JVM linking the native
library depends on the class name that is trying to link the native part, so
changing the class names will lead to failed linking at runtime.

Building and dependencies
-------------------------

**Zstd-jni** uses SBT for building the library and running the tests.

The build system depends on Scala and the tests depend on ScalaTest and
ScalaCheck but the produced JAR does not have any dependencies. It also
embeds the native library.

*Note*: For the moment the project depends on a local build of `sbt-java-module-info`
v0.5.2, as that version is not published to Maven. Before compiling, you need to publish it locally:
```
$ cd sbt-java-module-info && ./sbt publishLocal && cd -
```

Compile and test:
```
 $ ./sbt compile test package
```

If you want to publish it to you local ivy2 repository:
```
 $ ./sbt publishLocal
```

Binary releases
---------------

The binary releases are architecture dependent because we are embedding the
native library in the provided Jar file. Currently they are built for
*linux-amd64*, *linux-i386*, *linux-aarch64*, *linux-armhf*, *linux-ppc64*,
*linux-ppc64le*, *linux-mips64*, *linux-s390x*, *linux-riscv64*, *linux-loongarch64*,
*win-amd64*, *win-x86*, *win-aarch64*, *darwin-x86_64* (MacOS X), *darwin-aarch64*,
*aix-ppc64*, *freebsd-amd64*, and *freebsd-i386*.

More builds will be available if I get access to more platforms.

You can find published releases on Maven Central.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.luben</groupId>
        <artifactId>zstd-jni</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>

sbt dependency:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.luben" % "zstd-jni" % "VERSION"

Single architecture classified jars are also published. The classifier name is
following the "$OS_$ARCH" convention, but there is also a "cloud" classifier
that packs binaries just for *linux-amd64*, *linux-aarch64* (for deployment),
and *darwin-aarch64* (to help local development).

They can be used like:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.luben</groupId>
        <artifactId>zstd-jni</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
        <classifier>linux_amd64</classifier>
    </dependency>

or for sbt:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.luben" % "zstd-jni" % "VERSION" classifier "linux_amd64"

Link for direct download if you don't use a dependency manager:

 - https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/luben/zstd-jni/

If there is not yet a binary release compatible with your platform look how
to build it locally under the [Building](#building-and-dependencies) section.

Android support
---------------

Zstd-jni is usable in Android applications by importing the sources in Android
Studio. I guess using git submodules will also work.

Android archive (*zstd-jni.aar*) is also published on maven central. You will need
to add the repository in your build.gradle, e.g.:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            mavenCentral()
        }
    }

as it is not added by default by Android Studio. And then add dependency on the
prebuilt android archive (aar):

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.github.luben:zstd-jni:VERSION@aar"
        testImplementation "com.github.luben:zstd-jni:VERSION"
    }

For example Android app and how to declare dependencies and use zstd-jni, consult
the 2nd and 3rd commit of: https://github.com/luben/ZstdAndroidExample
